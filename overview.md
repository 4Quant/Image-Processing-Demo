To better illustrate the concepts of the last 4 lectures of the Micro- and Nanotomography Course in an interactive manner.
## Filtering
The filtering section shows the effect of several different filters on an image and allows you to adjust the settings for both __Neigbhorhood Size__ (the range for included pixels) and the __Sigma__ value which determines the how strongly the distance away a pixel is from the point is weighted.
## Gamma / Contrast Transfer
This section shows the effect of using different Gamma and Contrast transfer functions on the filtered image. The examples include standard transformations used as well as an extreme example with a sine function which would rarely make sense as a transfer function.
## Thresholding
The thresholding section shows the effect of different threshold values used. The image in this section comes from the Gamma section, so make sure the choice of contrast transfer function makes sense before trying to threshold.
## Morphology
